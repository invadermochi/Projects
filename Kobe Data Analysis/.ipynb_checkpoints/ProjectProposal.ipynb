We would have 10,000 rows of observations. The other dataset would be how often the top products were purchased, this would have different products as variables with around 10,000 observations of people and how much they bought of that product. We would use some form of web scraper to collect data from Twitter. We would store this data in a table and then use some form of graphs or plots to organise the data effectively."
